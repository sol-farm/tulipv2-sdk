# Overview

`tulipv2-sdk` is a set of crates for interacting with Tulip V2 vaults, and V1 lending programs via CPI, however it is also usable with off-chain rust clients. The goal of this crate is to provide an easy to use sdk for working with the Tulip Protocol, while also serving as a sort of "configuration file".

There are 4 main crates which are detailed below

# Crates

## [`common`](https://crates.io/crates/tulipv2-sdk-common)

The `common` folder contains a crate `tulipv2-sdk-common` which bundles together common functionality used by all the other crates, while also containing a module called `config` which provides configuration variables for easy configuration management. The configuration sub-modules can be enabled/disabled with feature flags enabling you to import only the required dependencies.

### `common/config/deposit_tracking`

Provides configuration variables, traits, and instructions for deposit tracking account management

### `common/config/levfarm`

This module contains files in the form of `ray_X.rs` for Raydium leveraged yield farms, and `orca_X.rs` for Orca leveraged yield farms. Additionally a submodule `common/config/levfarm/reserves` provides configuration variables for all of the lending reserves.

### `common/config/strategy`

This module contains configuration information for the V2 strategy vaults


## [`farms`](https://crates.io/crates/tulipv2-sdk-farms)

The `farms` folder contains a crate `tulipv2-sdk-farms` which provides an enum named `Farm`, which is used to describe different platforms (ie Raydium) and farms within those platforms (ie RAY-USDC). In addition to this the farm key itself is used to enable deterministic derivation of vault addresses that are self describing.

The wire representation of the farm type / farm key, is a 2 element slice of u64's, where the first element (farm identifier) is the protocol, and the second element is the particular vault for that protocol. 


## [`lending`](https://crates.io/crates/tulipv2-sdk-lending)

The `lending` folder contains a crate `tulipv2-sdk-lending` which provides very basic support for creating instructions, and issuing CPI calls to Tulip's V1 lending program. It allows for the lending of assets through the `Obligation` account, while also allowing the caller to refresh obligations and refresh reserves.

## [`leveraged`](https://crates.io/crates/tulipv2-sdk-leveraged)

The `leveraged` folder contains a crate `tulipv2-sdk-leveraged` which provides accounts, instructions, and various helper functions for interacting with Tulip's leveraged yield farms

## [`vaults`](https://crates.io/crates/tulipv2-sdk-vaults)

The `vaults` folder contains a crate `tulipv2-sdk-vaults` which provides all v2 vault account types, and associated helper functions, etc..

# Examples


The `examples` folder contains an anchor program that provides usage examples for all of the crates, including lending, leverage farming, v1/v2 vaults, etc.. In addition to this, anchor unit tests are provided which show how to invoke the example program instructions.

The example program uses mainnet account cloning to simulate real-world usage, however due to some peculiarities with mainnet cloned accounts and localnet, certain tests will fail, namely:

* raydium vault deposit/withdraw
* v2 strategy vault withdrawals

As such the anchor unit tests will catch these errors masking them to prevent confusion. All such instances are documented both in the anchor unit test comments

## Usage

Before running the examples you will need to prepare the test environment to work with your accounts. You should have a wallet address with the following balances for tests to work properly:

* 15 USDC
* 1 ORCA
* 1 ATLAS
* 1 USDr-USDC atrix lp token

Note, if all you're interested in is running the strategy vault test, you can have 10 USDC.
